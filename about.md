I find that the pure pigments of dry pastels are a wonderful medium to capture the nuances of light and the subtlety of color, which is what intrigues me. My work is realistic. My subject matter is the quiet but interesting detail of things that surround us every day that often go unnoticed—the gorgeous cabbage from the garden, the comical hen, the beautiful light highlighting a church steeple. It is a joy to spy these “happy finds” and a pleasure to share them in my artwork.

I am a graduate of Kutztown University with a BFA in Advertising Design (now called Communication Design). A forty year career in graphic design, art direction and publication design has been very gratifying. I am now able to enjoy focusing energy on my own art pursuits, particularly pastel painting.

I am a member of the Lehigh Art Alliance, the Bethlehem Palette Club and the Parkland Art League and have exhibited in juried shows with these groups since 2015. I studied pastels at the Baum School of Art with teacher and award-winning pastelist Jacqueline Myerson.

I have also exhibited at the Wesisenberg/Lowhill Township Historical Society, Governor Wolf Historical Society, Lehigh Nature Gap and C. Leslie Smith Silversmith.
